# About
**OnePSE** is a free, open-source Python game engine using the SDL graphics engine.
This project is the work of one person, CodCatDev (12 years), so every star on Github is a huge incentive for its creator!

Initially, the project was conceived as a game on Sdl2, but soon, due to the complexity of Sdl2, this engine was born to simplify the work with this graphics engine.
